**Data**

- The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It includes various driving scenarios and asks respondents if they would accept a coupon as a driver. Responses are categorized as:
  - "Right away" or "Later, before the coupon expires" (Y = 1)
  - "No, I do not want the coupon" (Y = 0)

- The survey covers five types of coupons: less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20â€“$50).
